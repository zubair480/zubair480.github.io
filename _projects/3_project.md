Imagine having a personal tutor readily available to answer your questions, no matter the subject. That's the idea behind NAVI, a web-based learning platform developed during the <a src="lablab.ai">`lablab.ai`</a> `openAI hackathon`.

NAVI empowers users to explore and understand a wide range of topics like a friendly guide. Whether you're curious about the intricacies of machine learning or have a burning question about history, NAVI is here to help.

How does it work? Think of NAVI as a powerful search engine on steroids. It leverages the cutting-edge technology of OpenAI's davinci-003 model to analyze vast amounts of information and generate informative answers to your queries.

But NAVI is more than just a search engine. It utilizes a process called "information retrieval," where it sifts through a massive collection of curated articles and websites, stored in a digital library called Elasticsearch. Using advanced algorithms, NAVI retrieves the most relevant information and presents it to you in a clear and concise manner.

This process involves several key players:

<ul>
<li>Haystack: This open-source framework acts as the maestro, orchestrating the entire information retrieval and answer generation process.
</li>
<li>Text-embedding-ada002: This model plays a crucial role in understanding the meaning of your questions and the information stored in the library. It essentially translates both the query and the information into a numerical format, allowing for efficient comparison.
</li>
<li>Davinci-003: Finally, this powerful language model takes the baton, using its vast knowledge and understanding of language to generate informative and comprehensive answers to your questions.</li>
</ul>

The project is still under development, but the team behind NAVI has ambitious plans for the future. They aim to incorporate features like:
Interactive quizzes and exercises: These tools will help you solidify your understanding of the learned concepts.
<ul> 
<li>
Personalized learning: NAVI will adapt to your individual learning style and pace, making the learning experience more engaging and effective.
</li>
<li>
Speech recognition: Imagine asking NAVI a question using your voice! This feature is on the horizon, making learning even more convenient.
</li>
</ul>
