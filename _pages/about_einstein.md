I am a prospective PhD candidate actively seeking opportunities for the fall/spring 2024 intake. Recently, I successfully completed a software engineering internship at Etihad Aviation Group World Headquarters, Abu Dhabi.

With a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Government College University Faisalabad Sahiwal Campus, I have built a strong foundation in problem-solving. I'm proficient in a wide array of programming languages and technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React, Angular, Tailwind, and Material UI for front-end development. On the back-end, I excel in Python, Flask, Node.js, Django, and am well-versed in database management with SQLite, SQL, and MongoDB. I'm also proficient in Docker for containerization and have experience with machine learning libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow.

I've also participated in numerous hackathons, including our victory at the Amadeus Hackathon 2022 and receiving the OAK-D camera at the Transatlantic Hackathon.

Sharing knowledge is a passion of mine. As a section leader at Stanford University's Code in Place course, I've had the pleasure of teaching Python and problem-solving to international students. In my home country, Pakistan, I've actively volunteered, teaching IELTS and Data Structures and Algorithms to underprivileged students.

I'm not just a coder but also a problem solver and a mentor. My experience and diverse skill set can be a valuable asset to a research lab. As a PhD student/researcher, I'm poised to bring my technical expertise and mentoring skills to the table, contributing to innovative solutions and fostering the development of future talents.
