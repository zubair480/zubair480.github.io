I am a Graduate Assistant at Eastern Illinois University, working in the university’s web development team as a Laravel Developer to enhance and support web infrastructure. Alongside this role, I am pursuing my Master’s degree in Computer/Information Technology at Eastern Illinois University, where I have studied advanced subjects such as Advanced Database Management, Networking, and Python for Data Science. I am actively seeking job opportunities for Fall 2026.

Recently, I successfully completed a software engineering internship at Etihad Aviation Group World Headquarters in Abu Dhabi. With a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Government College University Faisalabad Sahiwal Campus, I have built a strong foundation in problem-solving and software development.

I am proficient in a wide array of programming languages and technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React, Angular, Tailwind, and Material UI for front-end development. On the back-end, I excel in Python, Flask, Node.js, Django, and Laravel, and I am well-versed in database management with SQLite, SQL, and MongoDB. To make applications independent of infrastructure, I leverage Docker for containerization and image creation, and I also have experience with machine learning libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow.

I have participated in numerous hackathons, including our victory at the Amadeus Hackathon 2022 and receiving the OAK-D camera at the Transatlantic Hackathon.

Sharing knowledge has always been a passion of mine. As a Section Leader at Stanford University’s Code in Place course, I had the privilege of teaching Python and problem-solving to international students. In my home country, Pakistan, I actively volunteered, teaching IELTS and Data Structures and Algorithms to underprivileged students.

I am not just a coder but also a problem solver and mentor. My experience and diverse skill set allow me to contribute meaningfully to both professional environments and academic research. As a prospective PhD student and researcher, I am prepared to bring my technical expertise and mentoring ability to the table—driving innovative solutions while fostering the growth of future talent.
