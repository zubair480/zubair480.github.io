I am a prospective PhD candidate actively seeking opportunities for the fall/spring 2024 intake. Recently, I successfully completed a software engineering internship at Etihad Aviation Group World Headquarters, Abu Dhabi.

With a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Government College University Faisalabad Sahiwal Campus, I have built a strong foundation in problem-solving. I'm proficient in a wide array of programming languages and technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React, Angular, Tailwind, and Material UI for front-end development. On the back-end, I excel in Python, Flask, Node.js, Django, and am well-versed in database management with SQLite, SQL, and MongoDB. To make applications independent of infrastructure I use Docker for containerization and creating images and have experience with machine learning libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow.

I have also participated in numerous hackathons, including our victory at the Amadeus Hackathon 2022 and receiving the OAK-D camera at the Transatlantic Hackathon.

Sharing knowledge is a passion of mine. As a section leader at Stanford University's Code in Place course, I've had the pleasure of teaching Python and problem-solving to international students. In my home country, Pakistan, I've actively volunteered, teaching IELTS and Data Structures and Algorithms to underprivileged students.

I am not just a coder but also a problem solver and a mentor. My experience and diverse skill set can be a valuable asset to a research lab. As a PhD student/researcher, I'm poised to bring my technical expertise and mentoring skills to the table, contributing to innovative solutions and fostering the development of future talents.
